# Carpool-Project

## Project Idea:

**Description:** A practical tool for road trips that calculates total fuel costs and splits them among passengers based on the vehicle's efficiency.

**User Input:** Distance to travel (km/miles), the car's fuel efficiency (e.g., L/100km or MPG), the current price of gas, and the number of people in the car, their unit of measurement preference.

**App Output:** A breakdown showing the total cost of the trip, the cost per person, and a "frugality rating" based on how much they are saving by carpooling vs traveling alone.
