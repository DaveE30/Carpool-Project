# Carpool-Project

## Project Idea:

**Description:** A practical tool for road trips that calculates total fuel costs and splits them among passengers based on the vehicle's efficiency.

**User Input:** Distance to travel (km/miles), the car's fuel efficiency (e.g., L/100km or MPG), the current price of gas, and the number of people in the car, their unit of measurement preference.

**App Output:** A breakdown showing the total cost of the trip, the cost per person, and a "frugality rating" based on how much they are saving by carpooling vs traveling alone.

## Running the Program:
1. Run your virtual environment
2. To install the packages directly into your current Python environment, run this command in your terminal or command prompt:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. After the dependencies have downloaded, click the app.py file and run the file code.
4. Find the local host url in the terminal and click it while holding the ctrl button.
5. Have fun!
